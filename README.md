# Decription

This app will allow the user to select their current role in the company, their id, enter their name, and ask for their email. In addition to these prompts if the user is an intern or enginner, they will also link their github profile, and if this person is a manager, they will be able to enter their office number. This will print a card for each user's information. Only had a day to work on this due to some personal issue so it is not finished. My original repo also deleted everything for some reason after I moved some files around so I had to copy all of my files and place them into a new repo, hence the smaller number of commits, I tried to commit as often as possible to make up for it.
